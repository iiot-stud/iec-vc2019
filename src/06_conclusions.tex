\todo{Conclusion or Summary? Important Outlook}
\todo{- summary of our paper, - potential outcome, Result: the scientific surplus value, - Outlook: Basis for what kind of next work?}
\todo{more detailed, have to consider the outcomes of our paper, maybe bring pyramid in here to explain the current state but also the future work in combination with upcoming standards and initiatives --> that should be the basis of next work and may also be the scientific surplus value}

Edge computing is an architectural style for distributed systems. It's gaining popularity for many reasons, among others by reducing the costs of data transfer to the cloud or its own environment, reducing response time or enabling security - avoiding the transmission and storage of unsecured raw data in the cloud. Edge computing has its indisputable advantages, but it also has disadvantages. For this reason, it should be used deliberately in situations where the advantages will outweigh the drawbacks. In this paper we've presented in detail current challenges and visions related to edge computing. This work may be the basis for further research on the edge computing paradigm to establish dependencies and connections between cloud, edge and fog computing.
