The concept of edge computing (EC) is related to the internet of things (IoT) and is based on the idea of processing and storing data by end devices operating near them. Within the IoT context, challengingly requirements have to be met when applying this approach. Currently, most articles related to EC focus either on the advantages or disadvantages of this concept, which is why we present a precise list of requirements related to this approach. We carry out a detailed research based on a literature review and own representations of the information collected. The core contribution is to explain the main idea as well as to summarize the challenges that organizations are faced with when focusing on EC. Based on this work, EC concept can be investigated in order to answer the raising question of whether it can be treated as an extension or maybe even replacement of cloud computing.
