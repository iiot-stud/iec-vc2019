Edge computing is not a new phenomenon. This concept has already appeared some time ago but with a different characteristics. It is closely connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) and therefore highly related to the storage, processing and computation of data by end devices, controllers, or micro-data centers operating on the edge of the network. The purpose of this article is to present an up-to-date vision and review the main challenges of edge computing. In order to explain the main idea as well as to summarize the challenges that organizations are faced with when focusing on edge computing, we carry out a comprehensive research based on a literature review and own representations of the information collected. Our analysis shows that even with the enormous benefits that edge computing could deliver for industrial applications, the technological framework and the definition of common standards still take time to mature. Moreover the unrestricted adaptability to real world industrial applications is not fully sophisticated yet. Certainly, edge computing has great potential in the context of undertaking various digital initiatives especially in the context of Industrial IoT. However, organizations should follow an accepted and well-thought strategy when adapting edge computing, because the current challenges and the associated actions are complex and not to be underestimated.
