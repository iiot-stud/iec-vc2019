\section{Conclusion/Summary and Outlook}\label{sec:conclusions}

Edge computing is another architectural style for distributed systems. It's gaining popularity for many reasons, among others by reducing the costs of data transfer to the cloud or its own environment, reducing response time or cybersecurity - avoiding the transmission and storage of unsecured data in the cloud. Edge computing has its indisputable advantages, but it also has disadvantages. For this reason, it should be used deliberately in situations where the advantages will outweigh the drawbacks. In this paper we've presented in detail current challenges and visions related to edge computing. This work may be the basis for further research on the edge computing paradigm to establish dependencies and connections between cloud, edge and fog computing.
