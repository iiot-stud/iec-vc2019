  --title "The Edge Computing Paradigm for Smart Manufacturing" \
  --context "The digital transformation in industrial domains can contribute to ecologically sound, economically successful and socially balanced world."  \
  --problem "Within the manufacturing context, however, challengingly requirements have to be met when applying modern information and communication technologies."  \
  --work "Under the umbrella of the term Industry 4.0 a number of approaches are currently being discussed that often involve the use of centralized Cloud Computing components."  \
  --approach "In this paper, we discuss how the Edge Computing paradigm can address the specific challenges and augment Cloud Computing approaches."  \
  --result "The core contribution is to provide an overview of related standards, initiatives and future engineering issues."  \
  --evaluation "The results have been validated by interviews with domain experts."  \
  --outlook "Based on this work, a reference architecture model for Edge Computing could be developed to identify open research and engineering questions."
